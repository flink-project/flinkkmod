# What is flink?
flink enables any processors to communicate with an external FPGA over a serial interface. More information about the project can be found in [flink](http://wiki.ntb.ch/infoportal/software/flink).

## flinkLinux
flink Kernel Modules for Linux offer drivers capabilities to communicate with various hardware interfaces. Among them are PCI and SPI. 
This documentation is intended for developers to understand the internals of the core driver. This facilitates the creation of new modules for other hardware interfaces. The user documentation for flinkLinux can be found in [flink](http://wiki.ntb.ch/infoportal/software/flink/flink_linux).
